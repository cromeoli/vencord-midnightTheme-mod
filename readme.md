# Vencord Midnight Theme Modification

This is a CSS file that I use for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord). 

Loved the layout of [Midnight Theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/midnight), but sadly it does not have light theme. 

I modified the CSS so that I can have it and you can swap between dark/light on the "Appearance" tab of Discord.

Light theme is built with the [flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) light scheme, and I chose orange to be the accent color 

(Also orange accent in dark)

(sorry ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

## Installation

I use *"Edit Quick CSS"* option on vencord to apply the theme. 

Just copy/paste `midnightTheme-mod.css` content into it.
